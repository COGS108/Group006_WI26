    "Disparities in academic performance amongst students have long been attributed to differences in socioeconomic status among American students. Since senior year in high school marks the turning point in becoming an adult, we want to analyze the true disparity between the academic performance of high school seniors based on socioeconomic status to see if a relationship exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar yet older study by The American Physiological Association  analyzed the relationship between socioeconomic status and education. This study deemed, “Individuals within the top family income quartile are 8 times more likely to obtain a bachelor’s degree by age 24 as compared to individuals from the lowest family income quartile”<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 9 years old and 13 years old students in the United States have an increase in average scores for NAEP long-term trend (LTT) reading and mathematics assessments from 2018-2019 <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). Meanwhile, with the rise of academic performance, the data from the United States Census Bureau has informed us that there is a 6.8 percent increase (from $64,324 to $68,703) in household income in the United States <a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maria N. Wodarz, Natalia L. Komarova and Timmy Ma had done research for the relationship of English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics performance scores in 3rd and 8th grades and the median household income from during the 2018-2019 school year. The research found out, in half of the states, there is a linear correlation between academic performance and household income, and the other half characterized by a saturating function. The results reveal that less affluent states exhibit a steeper increase in performance with income compared to wealthier states <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). \n",
    "\n",
    "With the inquiry of the relationship for students in grade three and grade eight, it is important to examine whether this association persists for students in 12th grade. This stage represents a critical transition period, as many students are preparing for graduation and applying to undergraduate institutions. Since academic performance during the final year of high school can strongly influence college admissions opportunities, investigating the impact of household income on 12th grade achievement may provide deeper insight into how socioeconomic disparities shape educational outcomes at the point of entry into higher education.\n",

    "There is a positive correlation between state-level median household income and academic performance (average grades) among U.S. senior high school students during 2018-2019, such that states with higher median household income tend to have higher average student grades.

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The datasets we’re analyzing are derived from data collected through the decennial US census. The census is made compulsory for American households through Title 13, and non-respondents may be subject to fines or short-term incarceration. However, the federal government is required to maintain strict confidentiality through differential privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " \n",
    " > Participant anonymity is protected for 72 years by differential privacy, where statistical noise is added to the data to interfere with attempts to reidentify respondents. It maintains enough randomness to obscure data origin without compromising the integrity of the collection. Census data is re-released without redaction of personal information after 72 years have passed.\n",
    " \n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " \n",
    " > There is no mechanism in place to get individuals’ data removed from the Census. But personal information such as names, addresses, and contact information are removed from datasets before their information is added to the national database.\n",

    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    " \n",
    " > The federal government appears to keep census records indefinitely. After 72 years, the unredacted data is made publicly available and kept that way for research and genealogical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " \n",
    " >Each state sets its own standards of public education and curriculum requirements, so students in different states likely have different experiences. Also, a low reported household income or a poor credit score may not be an indicator of lived financial hardship. The data only allows us to speculate on the living situation rather than explicitly stating it.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",

    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " \n",
    " >It can be argued that financial disparities in this country are inherently discriminatory, given the nation’s history. The data observed is not race-specific, but the races of respondents are included.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " \n",
    " >Studies of this kind have been conducted across various demographics and in several other countries around the world. Adjusting for the local cost of living in each state will result in a model that is fairly generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " \n",
    " >The model is intended to identify possible correlations between a household’s degree of financial hardship and the children’s performance in school. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " \n",
    " >Users should not face retribution for displaying financial need or academic difficulties. This model is intended to identify need so financial support can be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
