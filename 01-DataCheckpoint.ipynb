    "Disparities in academic performance amongst students have long been attributed to differences in socioeconomic status among American students. Since the transition from middle school to high school marks the first step to adulthood, we want to look at the the academic performance for 8th graders and compare it to the socioeconmic status of their household. It is most often believed that students that perfrom well during 8th grade, tend to continue to perform well in highschool and further. Seeing as 8th grade has public testing and more accessible data, we will choose to analyze the relationship between socioeconomic status and academic performance within 8th graders\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar yet older study by The American Physiological Association analyzed the relationship between socioeconomic status and education. This study deemed, “Individuals within the top family income quartile are 8 times more likely to obtain a bachelor’s degree by age 24 as compared to individuals from the lowest family income quartile”<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",

    "According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 9 years old and 13 years old students in the United States have an increase in average scores for NAEP long-term trend (LTT) reading and mathematics assessments from 2018-2019 <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). Meanwhile, with the rise of academic performance, the data from the United States Census Bureau has informed us that there is a 6.8 percent increase (from 64,323 to 68,703 dollars) in household income in the United States <a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maria N. Wodarz, Natalia L. Komarova and Timmy Ma had done research for the relationship of English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics performance scores in 3rd and 8th grades and the median household income from during the 2018-2019 school year. The research found out, in half of the states, there is a linear correlation between academic performance and household income, and the other half characterized by a saturating function. The results reveal that less affluent states exhibit a steeper increase in performance with income compared to wealthier states <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). \n",
    "\n",
    "With the inquiry of the relationship between median household income and academic performance in 3rd and 8th grades, it is important to focus specifically on 8th grade students, as this stage represents a major academic and developmental transition. During 8th grade, students are preparing to enter high school, and their academic achievement can influence placement into advanced courses, access to academic resources, and long-term educational opportunities. By analyzing this relationship, this research can help identify whether economic differences between states are strongly associated with measurable gaps in academic performance.\n",

    "There is a positive correlation between state-level median household income and academic performance (average grades) among U.S. 8th grade students during 2018-2019, such that states with higher median household income tend to have higher average student grades. We believe that higher household income means access to better academic resources and financial improvement shapes students self-confidence, therefore, with the increase of household income, students would have a better academic performance. We also believe that students that test better in 8th grade tend to have better academic success in high school."

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.
