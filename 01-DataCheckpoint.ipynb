    "Disparities in academic performance amongst students have long been attributed to differences in socioeconomic status among American students. Since the transition from middle school to high school marks the first step to adulthood, we want to look at the the academic performance for 8th graders and compare it to the socioeconmic status of their household. It is most often believed that students that perfrom well during 8th grade, tend to continue to perform well in highschool and further. Seeing as 8th grade has public testing and more accessible data, we will choose to analyze the relationship between socioeconomic status and academic performance within 8th graders.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar yet older study by The American Physiological Association analyzed the relationship between socioeconomic status and education. This study deemed, “Individuals within the top family income quartile are 8 times more likely to obtain a bachelor’s degree by age 24 as compared to individuals from the lowest family income quartile”<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 9 years old and 13 years old students in the United States have an increase in average scores for NAEP long-term trend (LTT) reading and mathematics assessments from 2018-2019 <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). Meanwhile, with the rise of academic performance, the data from the United States Census Bureau has informed us that there is a 6.8 percent increase (from 64,323 to 68,703 dollars) in household income in the United States <a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maria N. Wodarz, Natalia L. Komarova and Timmy Ma had done research for the relationship of English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics performance scores in 3rd and 8th grades and the median household income from during the 2018-2019 school year. The research found out, in half of the states, there is a linear correlation between academic performance and household income, and the other half characterized by a saturating function. The results reveal that less affluent states exhibit a steeper increase in performance with income compared to wealthier states <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). \n",
    "\n",
    "With the inquiry of the relationship between median household income and academic performance in 3rd and 8th grades, it is important to focus specifically on 8th grade students, as this stage represents a major academic and developmental transition. During 8th grade, students are preparing to enter high school, and their academic achievement can influence placement into advanced courses, access to academic resources, and long-term educational opportunities. By analyzing this relationship, this research can help identify whether economic differences between states are strongly associated with measurable gaps in academic performance.\n",

   "source": [
    "There is a positive correlation between state-level median household income and academic performance (average grades) among U.S. 8th grade students during 2018-2019, such that states with higher median household income tend to have higher average student grades. We believe that higher household income means access to better academic resources and financial improvement shapes students self-confidence, therefore, with the increase of household income, students would have a better academic performance. We also believe that students that test better in 8th grade tend to have better academic success in high school."

    "- Number of Observations: 1,048,575\n",
    "- Number of Variables: 56\n",
    "- Description of Variables:\n",
    "    - stateabb - state abbreviation, which can be used in state-level comparison year: academic year, including years between 2009 and 2018 (inclusive), can be used to filter out year 2018 to 2019.\n",
    "    - grade - grade level, from grade 3 to grade 8. We are including grade 8 instead of senior high school students.\n",
    "    - subject - the subject that the students are studying. It can be used to group students and compare their academic performance.\n",
    "    - tot_asmt_all - the total number of students assessed. It is the sample size of different districts.\n",
    "    - gcs_mn_all: the mean GCS score for students. This is the dependent variable that represents academic performance.\n",
    "    - gcs_mn_ecd: the mean score for economically disadvantaged students.\n",
    "    - gcs_mn_nec: the mean score for non-economically disadvantaged students.\n",
    "        - The above variables will help filter between 2018-2019, exclusively 8th grade, and compare scores based on income levels.\n",
    "- Description of Shortcomings:\n",
    "    - The income data is not included. This dataset only includes students’ academic performance, and divides the students into economically disadvantaged students and non_economically disadvantaged students. There are missing values in the variables related to our project. For example, gcs_mn_ecd and gcs_mn_nec.\n",

    "- Number of Variables: 73\n",
    "- Description of Variables:\n",
    "    - lninc50all: log of median income, eb estimate, all families, time-varying. This represents the log-transformed median household income (median income across families). This is the closest match to state-level median household income in the dataset.\n",
    "    - povertyall: poverty rate, eb estimate, all families, time-varying. This represent the overall poverty rate. This is another variable which we could consider to determine the relationship between academic performance and household income.\n",
    "    - year and grade: These two variables ensure you are analyzing 8th graders in the 2018–2019 school year.\n",
    "    - urbanicity: urbanicity locale (based on student enrollment).This could be considered as one of the factors affecting the household income.\n",
    "    - fips and stateabb: These allow you to group by state to create state-level averages.\n",
    "    - There are also income and poverty data for different racial which could also be considered while analyzing.\n",
    "- Description of Shortcomings:\n",
    "    - The data is aggregated at the district level, not individual-level student data.\n",
    "    - Many variables came from ACS,  some values may be produced using modeling or smoothing methods (such as “EB estimates,” empirical Bayes).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we plan on combing these?\n",
    "- We plan on combining these by using school district id's (sedaadmin). This will allow us to match up the scores of the 8th graders and the socioeconmic status that their school districts fall under."

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The datasets we’re analyzing are derived from data collected through the decennial US census. The census is made compulsory for American households through Title 13, and non-respondents may be subject to fines or short-term incarceration. However, the federal government is required to maintain strict confidentiality through differential privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " \n",
    " > Participant anonymity is protected for 72 years by differential privacy, where statistical noise is added to the data to interfere with attempts to reidentify respondents. It maintains enough randomness to obscure data origin without compromising the integrity of the collection. Census data is re-released without redaction of personal information after 72 years have passed.\n",
    " \n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " \n",
    " > There is no mechanism in place to get individuals’ data removed from the Census. But personal information such as names, addresses, and contact information are removed from datasets before their information is added to the national database.\n",

    " \n",
    " > The federal government appears to keep census records indefinitely. After 72 years, the unredacted data is made publicly available and kept that way for research and genealogical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " \n",
    " >Each state sets its own standards of public education and curriculum requirements, so students in different states likely have different experiences. Also, a low reported household income or a poor credit score may not be an indicator of lived financial hardship. The data only allows us to speculate on the living situation rather than explicitly stating it.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",

    " \n",
    " >The datasets used to generate this analysis are publicly available and accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " \n",
    " >It can be argued that financial disparities in this country are inherently discriminatory, given the nation’s history. The data observed is not race-specific, but the races of respondents are included.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " \n",
    " >Studies of this kind have been conducted across various demographics and in several other countries around the world. Adjusting for the local cost of living in each state will result in a model that is fairly generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " \n",
    " >The model is intended to identify possible correlations between a household’s degree of financial hardship and the children’s performance in school. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " \n",
    " >Users should not face retribution for displaying financial need or academic difficulties. This model is intended to identify need so financial support can be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
