The research found out, in half of the states, there is a linear correlation between academic performance and household income, and the other half characterized by a saturating function.

Since academic performance during the final year of high school can strongly influence college admissions opportunities, investigating the impact of household income on 12th grade achievement may provide deeper insight into how socioeconomic disparities shape educational outcomes at the point of entry into higher education.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",

For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
